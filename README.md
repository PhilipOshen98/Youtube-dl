# Youtube-dl


Youtube video downloader coded in c++. Using this as a test of my abilities. 
This program will be worked on in the near future. I currently do not possess enough knowledge in C++ to create a youtube video downloader. I am currently in an accelerated CS class for C++ and hope to be able to do this on the side as well. The finished product should be able to download any youtube video, granted the user can see the video in accordance with their geographgical copyright aggreements. This project is for educational purposes only.
